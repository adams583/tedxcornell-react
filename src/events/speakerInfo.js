      carrying with him to the Ivy League a desire to better the lives of
      people. As the creator and host of Black Voices on the Hill,

      able to reach thousands in upstate New York, talking weekly 
      about racism, sexism, and activism, with guests ranging from TikTok 
    sensations, investment fund creators, to the city mayor himself. As a
     mentor at a local carceral facility and president of the Labor School

    "speechInfo": `In her private practice she works in partnership 
    with clients to nourish awareness and connection to innate essence.
  For over 30 years her interest and focus on trauma has led her
  to understand the healing process as an intimate re-connection to self, 
  others, and the world, through compassion, acceptance, and honoring of 
  each other’s human spirit. In addition to working with trauma and PTSD, 
  she has dedicated her professional life to teaching, and research. With 
  clients she uses art as a vehicle for deepening and processing experiences 
  through non-verbal autobiographical storytelling. For the Multidisciplinary 
  Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), Marcela has worked as therapist 
  and Principal Investigator for various studies weaving psychotherapy and MDMA 
  for the treatment of PTSD. Additionally, she is a trainer and supervisor 
  for MAPS’ MDMA-assisted psychotherapy training program.`
