# TEDxCornellUniversity 2019 Website React Project

This project was started to create a website using React for TEDxCornellUniversity. This website was used for TEDxCornellUniversity's 2019 event and is currently up and running at tedxcornell.com.

### Improvement List for 2021-2022 year:

- Clean up repo: refactor to use functional components and hooks, remove unnecessary code and image files, shorten/reorganize/optimize code
- Use sass instead of plain CSS to clean up stylings, take advantage of variables for color scheme, and import only necessary CSS (child components get parent's imported styles currently)
- Improve website's mobile experience
- Add speaker videos
- Release new theming/revamp for the 2022 event

#### Lower priority todos:

- Transition to using typescript
- Transition to using the latest version of react-bootstrap
